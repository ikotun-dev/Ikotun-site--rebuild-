# ME

### This is me testing the blogging section of my website. Also me saying a little story. I decided to build this blog cos I just wanna write my thoughts somewhere but not in a diary/book 
### Well, This part  is an highlight, just a little emphasy on the texts here. This Blog won't be specifically code related alone but talks about life as well, I hope you find it fun.
    
### I got my first laptop in 2014, 9 years ago - Was a white hp computer, portable and girly. It was my sister's ex-laptop. Coding didn't start from there, was just watching youtube and playing zuma revenge. Then months later - a man(early twenties)  came to spend a night in my house and I saw him on his computer saw some bunch of jumbled-up texts on a black background. Out of curiousity, I asked him what it was. He said he was build an application for his department. 

### He showed me the user interface and said it was the 'code' - jumbled-up texts ðŸ˜‚ that gave him this beautiful user interface and boom :) a journey began. I asked if he could teach me, well he could'nt - He was just spending one night. He recommended  learning `HTML` and yeah I did for a while and left it sadly.",

### Fastforward to 2017, I picked up python- I watched the whole Telusko python playlist on youtube { highly recommend }. It's been an adventure since then!
