This is me testing the blogging section of my website. Also me saying a little story. I decided to build this blog because I just want to write my thoughts somewhere but not in a diary/book.

Well, this part is a highlight, just a little emphasis on the texts here. This blog won't be specifically code-related alone but talks about life as well. I hope you find it fun.

I got my first laptop in 2014, 9 years ago. It was a white HP computer, portable and girly. It was my sister's ex-laptop. Coding didn't start from there; I was just watching YouTube and playing Zuma Revenge. Then months later, a man (early twenties) came to spend a night in my house, and I saw him on his computer saw some bunch of jumbled-up texts on a black background. Out of curiosity, I asked him what it was. He said he was building an application for his department.

He showed me the user interface and said it was the 'code' - jumbled-up texts ğŸ˜‚ that gave him this beautiful user interface and boom! A journey began. I asked if he could teach me, well, he couldn't - he was just spending one night. He recommended learning ~HTML~, and yeah, I did for a while and left it sadly.

Fast forward to 2017, I picked up Python. I watched the whole Telusko Python playlist on YouTube { highly recommend }. It's been an adventure since then.

print('Testing code snippet')
